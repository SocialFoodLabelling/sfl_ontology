# The Ontology for the Social Food Labelling Project

## File Organisation
  * social_food_labelling.ttl
    Defines new classes and properties, as subclasses/subproperties of existing ontologies
  * sfl_mappings.ttl
    Maps our ontologies to existing entities in other ontologies (equivalentClass/Property), defines
    meta-annotations to existing entities in other ontologies (eg, skos:prefLabel), defines our own axioms involving existing 
    entities in other ontologies (eg, off:Ingredient as subclass of off:Food).

##Â Ontology organisation
